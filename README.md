### Welcome!
I'm currently working on building a data analytics project portfolio. In 2021, I left my IT career to focus on family. Now, I'm exploring options for returning to work - as a data analyst. I've taken a long list of classes, but nothing beats hands-on practice for building new skills!

If you'd like to connect, please message me on LinkedIn.
